          <h2>THESIS  BUCKET HATS</h2>
          <p> Thesis Bucket Hats is a Sowetan born brand, deep in the townships of Orlando. Ayanda Zithebe, co-founder of Thesis, says it's 
              always been his dream to do something for the community of Soweto, and what better way is there to do it than to give people a
              chance to put bread on the table?! 
              Having 17 employees at the factory, The Thesis bucket hats are perfectly handcrafted to resemble the old Kwaito hats people used
              to wear in the olden days, with a little flavour of the 2000s and you have your winner!
