          <h2>BUGGATTI Niniette 66</h2>
         <p>
          We’ll get to the Jacuzzi and fire pit in a second. First, let’s talk about how this thing came into existence. Two years ago, 
          Bugatti announced that it would produce a series of three luxe boats in collaboration yacht builder Palmer Johnson. 
          The series would be called "Niniette,” which was the nickname of Lidia Bugatti, daughter of company founder Ettore. 
          As you might expect with a Bugatti-branded boat, all three are covered in titanium and carbon fiber, accented by Bugatti's 
          trademark blue. The Niniette 66 is the first in the series, ranging from 50 to 80 feet in length. It retains many of Bugatti’s signature engineering 
         traits, such as the accentuated center line, symmetry, and a sweeping signature curve. It’s not exactly a speed demon, though, with the ability to reach a top speed of 44 knots (50 mph). But the real clincher with this yacht was its absurd number of ultra-luxury accessories.
          $4 Million V8 power takes the fastest Niniette to a claimed top speed of 44knots, or 50mph in ground-speed. For a water-borne machine, that’s really shifting. Different lengths of hull ranging from 50 to 80 feet will be available, depending on how many folks you’d like to entertain aboard your Niniette.
