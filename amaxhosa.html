            MAXHOSA AFRICA is a South African knitwear brand founded in 2012 by Laduma Ngxokolo. This was with desire to explore knitwear 
            design solutions that would be suitable for amakrwala (Xhosa initiates). His initial vision was to create a modern Xhosa-inspired 
            knitwear collection that would be suitable for this market. As a person who has undergone the process, Laduma felt that he had to 
            develop premium knitwear that celebrates traditional Xhosa aesthetics.
